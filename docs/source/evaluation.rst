Utilizing the generated representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs), one can conduct a comprehensive evaluation against neural data. **Net2Brain** provides access to three distinct datasets for exploration purposes. For those possessing custom datasets, ensure the neural activation data adheres to the following formats: *[subject, stimuli, stimuli]* or *[subject, time, stimuli, stimuli]*.

Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA)
------------------------------------------

The RSA module within **Net2Brain** simplifies the performance of RSA, offering a DataFrame output with correlation values and statistical significance markers. For RSA execution, supply:

- **model_rdms_path**: Directory containing the model RDMs.
- **brain_rdms_path**: Directory containing the brain RDMs.
- **model_name**: Identifier for the model, significant for plotting.

.. code-block:: python

    # Example using AlexNet
    from net2brain.evaluations.rsa import RSA
    
    # Initialize RSA
    rsa_evaluation = RSA(model_rdms_path, brain_rdms_path, model_name="AlexNet")
    
    # Conduct Evaluation - Yields a DataFrame
    results_df = rsa_evaluation.evaluate()
    
    # Display the Results
    print(results_df)

Significant Model Comparisons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the objective is to ascertain whether one model outperforms another significantly and not by mere chance, the `compare_model` feature comes into play.

.. code-block:: python

    test_statistic, significant_pairs = rsa_evaluation.compare_model(another_evaluation)

Visualizing RSA Results
-----------------------

The built-in plotting capabilities of **Net2Brain** facilitate the visualization of evaluation metrics. Initialize the `Plotting` class with the evaluation DataFrames, ensuring each one:

1. Shares identical regions of interest (ROIs) indicating tests on the same brain RDMs.
2. Features a unique model identifier, set manually or via the "model_name" during the evaluation process.

Required for plotting:

- **dataframes**: A single DataFrame from the evaluation or a list of them.
- **pairs**: (Optional) A list of significant pairs derived from the evaluation function.
- **metric**: (Optional) The evaluation metric, either RÂ² or R.

.. code-block:: python

    from net2brain.evaluations.plotting import Plotting
    
    # Single DataFrame plotting
    single_plotter = Plotting([results_df])
    single_plotter.plot()

    # Plotting all layers
    single_plotter.plot_all_layers()
    
    # Multiple DataFrames plotting
    multiple_plotter = Plotting([results_df, another_results_df])
    multiple_plotter.plot(pairs=significant_pairs)




Weighted RSA
----------------

**Net2Brain** extends support for Weighted RSA, incorporating weights into the analysis to refine model 
performance assessment and the study of neural representation correlations with computational models.

WRSA necessitates:

- **model_rdms_path**: Directory containing the model RDMs.
- **brain_rdms_path**: Directory containing the brain RDMs.
- **model_name**: Identifier for the model, significant for plotting.

.. code-block:: python

    # Example with WRSA
    from net2brain.evaluations.wrsa import WRSA
    
    # Initialize WRSA
    wrsa_evaluation = WRSA(model_rdms_path, brain_rdms_path, model_name="ResNet50")
    
    # Perform Evaluation - Produces a DataFrame
    wrsa_results_df = wrsa_evaluation.evaluate()
    
    # Output the Results
    print(wrsa_results_df)



Searchlight RSA
---------------

For a focused analysis, the toolbox offers a searchlight RSA functionality, which requires Searchlight 
RDMs formatted as *[ROI, subject, stimuli, stimuli]*. Note that this toolbox does not provide RDMs for demonstration purposes,
but users can apply the feature if they have suitable RDMs.

.. code-block:: python

    from net2brain.evaluations.searchlight import Searchlight
    
    # Initialize Searchlight
    searchlight_evaluation = Searchlight(model_rdms_path, searchlight_rdms_path)
    
    # Conduct Evaluation - Returns a DataFrame
    searchlight_results_df = searchlight_evaluation.evaluate()
    
    # Present the Results
    print(searchlight_results_df)



Linear Encoding Models:
----------------

Another integrated analysis pipeline is a linear encoder. Given a npy file with voxel values, and extracted features, the encoder performs an X-fold regression where the training data is used to train a PCA embedding and a linear regression to predict voxel values. The output is the testing split X-fold average pearson correlation.

.. note::

Prerequisites for the linear encoding function include:

- **feat_path**: The file path directing to the model's features.
- **roi_path**: The file path for brain data formatted as RDM.
- **model_name**: The identifier for the model, crucial for subsequent visualization.
- **trn_tst_split**: (Optional) specifies the train-test data ratio per fold, with a default of 0.8.
- **n_folds**: (Optional) The cross-validation folds count, preset to 3.
- **n_components**: (Optional) The PCA components quantity, defaulting to 100.
- **batch_size**: (Optional) The incremental PCA's batch size, with a standard value of 100.

.. code-block:: python

    from net2brain.evaluations.encoding import Linear_Encoding
    
    results_dataframe = Linear_Encoding(
        feat_path,
        roi_path,
        model_name,
        n_folds=3,
        trn_tst_split=0.8,
        n_components=100,
        batch_size=100
        return_correlations=True,
        save_path="path/to/csv"
    )




Variance Partitioning Analysis (VPA)
----------------

.. note::

   Run and test this code by using `this notebook <https://github.com/cvai-roig-lab/Net2Brain/blob/main/notebooks/Workshops/Net2Brain_EEG_Cutting_Edge_Workshop.ipynb>`_!



**Net2Brain** enhances model and cerebral data assessment through Variance Partitioning Analysis. 
This technique supports the evaluation of **up to four independent variables** in relation to a 
**singular dependent variable**, typically the neural data.

The requirements for VPA are:

- **dependent_variable**: The RDM-formatted path to the brain data.
- **independent_variable**: An array of arrays, each containing RDM paths belonging to a specific group.
- **variable_names**: The labels for the independent variables, integral for visualization.

Returns:
- **dataframe**: Contains all unique and shared variances. Dataframe can be filtered to only contain relevant information



.. code-block:: python

    from net2brain.evaluations.variance_partitioning_analysis import VPA

    independent_variables = [paths_to_RDM_folder_1, paths_to_RDM_folder_2, paths_to_RDM_folder_3, paths_to_RDM_folder_4]
    variable_names = ["Ind_Var1", "Ind_Var2", "Ind_Var3", "Ind_Var4"]

    VPA_eval = VPA(dependent_variable, independent_variables, variable_names)
    dataframe = VPA_eval.evaluate(average_models=True)

    # Filter the dataframe to include only the unique variances and the shared variance by all variables
    dataframe = dataframe.query("Variable in ['y1234', 'y1', 'y2', 'y3', 'y4']").reset_index(drop=True)




Plotting VPA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The plotting utilities of **Net2Brain** offer the capability to visualize time-course data. 
The `plotting_over_time` function includes an optional standard deviation overlay to enrich the
graphical representation.

- **add_std**: Enable to display the standard deviation on the graph. Defaults to False.


.. code-block:: python

    from net2brain.evaluations.plotting import Plotting

    # Plotting with significance
    plotter = Plotting(dataframe)

    plotter.plotting_over_time(add_std=True)



Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA)
----------------

Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) is a similarity metric used to compare two datasets, such as DNN-derived features and brain activity, based on the relationships within each dataset. Unlike traditional correlations, CKA is scale-invariant and focuses on the structure of pairwise similarities within each dataset.

.. note::

   Run and test this code by using `this notebook <https://github.com/cvai-roig-lab/Net2Brain/blob/main/notebooks/3_Evaluation.ipynb>`_!

Prerequisites for the CKA function include:

- **feat_path**: The file path directing to the model's feature `.npz` files, where each file contains multiple layer activations.
- **brain_path**: The file path for `.npy` files containing brain data, with each file representing a specific ROI.
- **model_name**: The identifier for the model, crucial for labeling the output.

Returns:
- **dataframe**: Contains CKA scores for each ROI and each layer of the DNN.

.. code-block:: python

    from net2brain.evaluations.cka import CKA

    results_dataframe = CKA.run(
        feat_path="path/to/features",
        brain_path="path/to/brain_data",
        model_name="model_name"
    )


Distributional Comparison (DC)
----------------

Distributional Comparison evaluates the similarity between datasets by comparing the feature-wise distributions. Two metrics are available:
- **Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD):** Measures the divergence between two probability distributions. It is symmetric and bounded between 0 and 1.
- **Wasserstein Distance (WD):** Also known as Earth Mover's Distance, measures the cost of transforming one distribution into the other.

.. note::

   Run and test this code by using `this notebook <https://github.com/cvai-roig-lab/Net2Brain/blob/main/notebooks/3_Evaluation.ipynb>`_!

Prerequisites for the Distributional Comparison function include:

- **feat_path**: The file path directing to the model's feature `.npz` files, where each file contains multiple layer activations.
- **brain_path**: The file path for `.npy` files containing brain data, with each file representing a specific ROI.
- **metric**: The distance metric used to compare distributions. Options are:
  - **"jsd"**: Jensen-Shannon Divergence.
  - **"wasserstein"**: Wasserstein Distance.
- **model_name**: The identifier for the model, crucial for labeling the output.

.. warning::

   If the feature lengths differ between the feature data and brain data, PCA is applied to reduce dimensionality to the same size. While this ensures compatibility, it alters the feature space.

Returns:
- **dataframe**: Contains distributional comparison scores for each ROI and each layer of the DNN.

.. code-block:: python

    from net2brain.evaluations.distributional_comparisons import DistributionalComparison

    # Using Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD)
    results_jsd = DistributionalComparison.run(
        feat_path="path/to/features",
        brain_path="path/to/brain_data",
        metric="jsd",
        model_name="model_name"
    )

    # Using Wasserstein Distance (WD)
    results_wasserstein = DistributionalComparison.run(
        feat_path="path/to/features",
        brain_path="path/to/brain_data",
        metric="wasserstein",
        model_name="model_name"
    )

This raises an important question: Are these correlations meaningful or coincidental? To delve deeper into this, we have a couple of strategies we could pursue. One approach is to initialize the models with random weights by using `FeatureExtractor(model, netset, pretrained=False)`. Another strategy involves shuffling the captions to see if the models maintain their predictive performance even when there's a mismatch between the captions and the brain data. To skip the step of feature extraction, we can just mix the extracted features!"

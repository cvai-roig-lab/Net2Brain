<img src="docs/source/Net2Brain_Logo.png" alt="Net2Brain Logo" width="50%"/>


Welcome to __Net2Brain__, a powerful toolbox designed to facilitate the comparison of human brain activity patterns with the activations of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). With over 600 pre-trained DNNs available, Net2Brain empowers neuroscientists to explore and analyze the relationships between artificial and biological neural representations.

Net2Brain is a collaborative effort between CVAI and Radek Cichy's lab, aimed at providing a user-friendly toolbox for neural research with deep neural networks. 

**All-in-One Solution**: 
Net2Brain offers an all-in-one solution by providing access to over 600 pretrained neural networks, specifically trained for various visual tasks. This extensive collection allows researchers to extract features from a diverse range of models, including pretrained and random architectures. Moreover, Net2Brain offers flexibility by allowing users to integrate their own models, thereby expanding the scope of experiments that can be conducted to evaluate brain responses.

**Bridging Neural and AI Research**:
One of the primary objectives of Net2Brain is to facilitate the collaboration between neural and AI research. By providing a user-friendly toolbox, we aim to bridge the gap and empower non-computer scientists to leverage the benefits of deep neural networks in their neuroscientific investigations.

# Compatibility and System Requirements

# Installation

To install Net2Brain and its dependencies, please follow these steps:

1. Install the repository on your machine. You can use the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install -U git+https://github.com/cvai-roig-lab/Net2Brain
```

2. Once the installation is complete, you can import Net2Brain in your Python environment and start utilizing its powerful features for neural research.




# Model Taxonomy

__Net2Brain__ provides a comprehensive model taxonomy system to assist users in selecting the most suitable models for their studies. This taxonomy system classifies models based on attributes such as dataset, training method, and visual task. Let's take a look at an example that showcases the usage of the taxonomy system:

```python
from net2brain.feature_extraction import show_taxonomy
from net2brain.feature_extraction import find_model_by_dataset
from net2brain.feature_extraction import find_model_by_training_method
from net2brain.feature_extraction import find_model_by_visual_task
from net2brain.feature_extraction import find_model_by_custom

# Show the taxonomy
show_taxonomy()

# Find models based on dataset
find_model_by_dataset("Taskonomy")

# Find models based on training method
find_model_by_training_method("SimCLR")

# Find models based on visual task
find_model_by_visual_task("Panoptic Segmentation")

# Find models based on custom attributes
find_model_by_custom(["COCO", "Object Detection"], model_name="fpn")
```

This taxonomy system provides a convenient way to search for models that align with specific research requirements.






# Examples of the Toolbox

## Feature Extraction

> Note: For more detailed instructions and customization options, refer to the provided notebooks and documentation.

Net2Brain allows you to extract features from a variety of pretrained models or your own custom models. This feature extraction process is crucial for analyzing neural network representations and comparing them with human brain activity patterns.

To extract features using Net2Brain, follow these steps:

```python
from net2brain.feature_extraction import FeatureExtractor
fx = FeatureExtractor(model='AlexNet', netset='Standard', device='cpu')

# Extract features from a dataset
fx.extract(data_path=stimuli_path, save_path='AlexNet_Feat')

# Consolidate features per layer (Optional)
fx.consolidate_per_layer()
```
In this example, we use the FeatureExtractor class to extract features from the AlexNet model. The extracted features are saved in a .npz file.

Net2Brain provides flexibility in selecting models, choosing layers for feature extraction, and saving the extracted features.


## Creating RDMs

> Note: For more detailed instructions and customization options, refer to the provided notebooks and documentation.

After feature extraction, the next step is to create Representational Dissimilarity Matrices (RDMs) using Net2Brain's RDM Creator.

To generate RDMs, follow these steps:

```python
from net2brain.rdm_creation import RDMCreator

feat_path = "AlexNet_Feat"
save_path = "AlexNet_RDM"


# Call the Class with the path to the features
creator = RDMCreator(verbose=True, device='cpu') 
save_path = creator.create_rdms(feature_path=feat_path, save_path=save_path, save_format='npz') 

```
In this example, the RDMCreator class is used to create RDMs from previously extracted features using the AlexNet model. The extracted features are located at feat_path, and the resulting RDMs will be saved at save_path.

The RDM Creator calculates dissimilarities between neural representations of different images and generates RDMs with a shape of (#Images, #Images) for each specified layer. These RDMs provide insights into the similarities and differences in neural representations.






## Evaluation: RSA and Plotting
> Note: For more detailed instructions and customization options, refer to the provided notebooks and documentation.

Net2Brain provides powerful evaluation capabilities to analyze and compare the representations of neural networks. One of the key evaluation metrics available is RSA (Representational Similarity Analysis). Additionally, the toolbox offers integrated plotting functionality to visualize evaluation results.
RSA Evaluation

To perform RSA evaluation, follow these steps:

```python
from net2brain.evaluations.rsa import RSA
from net2brain.utils.download_datasets import load_dataset

# Load the ROIs
stimuli_path, roi_path = load_dataset("bonner_pnas2017")

# Define the paths to the model and brain RDMs
model_rdms = "AlexNet_RDM"
brain_rdms = roi_path

# Start RSA evaluation
evaluation_alexnet = RSA(model_rdms, brain_rdms, model_name="AlexNet")

# Evaluate and obtain a pandas DataFrame
dataframe1 = evaluation_alexnet.evaluate()

# Display the results
display(dataframe1)
```

## Plotting RSA Evaluation Results

The integrated plotting functionality of Net2Brain allows you to easily visualize the RSA evaluation results. To plot the data using a single DataFrame, use the following code:

```python
from net2brain.evaluations.plotting import Plotting

# Initialize the plotter with the DataFrame
plotter = Plotting([dataframe1])

# Plot the results
# Optionally, pass metrix='R' if you do not want to lot with R2
results_dataframe = plotter.plot()
```

Refer to the provided notebooks and documentation for detailed instructions on customizing RSA evaluation and exploring additional options offered by Net2Brain


## Other Evaluation methods
`Net2Brain` has the ability to perform a wide range of evaluation methods to evaluate the correlation beetween artifical and biological network responses. Among those are:
1. RSA
2. Weighted RSA
3. Searchlight Evaluation
4. Linear Encoding
5. Variance Partitioning Analysis
